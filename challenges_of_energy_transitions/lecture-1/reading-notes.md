## How should we distribute the global carbon budget?

Sources say we have about a cumulative 100gt CO2 available to release before we are likely to exceed 1.5C. This in effect means there is a global carbon budget. How should this be distributed across countries? The article mentions two approaches - 'Equal-Per-Capita' and 'Per-capita convergence'

### Equal-Per-Capita

Let's give every person an equal carbon budget starting today, and thus.

$country = budget_person * population$

### Per-capita convergence (aka Contraction and convergence)

Let's accept current countries levels of emission as a starting point for budget allocation. This is to avoid asking for the impossible (getting rich countries to drop their emissions overnight). By the end of the period (2050) - the budget is allocated on an equal-per-capita basis

Criticisms: rich countries continute to benefit from emission-causing activities

### Present generation responsibility for past generation emissions?
