# The great acceleration - an environmental history since 1945

### Introduction

- all of human history has taken place in the Holocene (last 11,700 years or so)
- This book introduces the idea of **anthropocene** as a distinct epoch
- This term was coined by Paul Crutzen in 1995
- Factors defining anthropocene:
    - Release of greenhouse gases
    - Massive population growth
Definition: human action becomes the most important factor governing the major biogeochemical cycles:
- major biogeochemical cycles:
    - carbon cycle
    - nitrogen cycle
    - sulfur cycle


### Chapter 1: Energy and Population

- every energy technology results in the loss of some useful energy

### Terms

The Great Acceleration - time since 1945 in which humans have shaped the climate by affecting 3 major biogeochemical cycles

Biota - the full set of living things in an area

Technologies that increased the amount of energy we could harvest:  (i.e they convert a 'useless' store of energy into a 'useful' one)

- fire allows humans to harness more energy
- agriculture 
- windmills and water mills
