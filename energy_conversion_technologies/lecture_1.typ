/ saturated mixture: two-phase mixture of liquid and vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium at a given pressure or temperature. It occurs at exactly one $T=T_{"sat"}$ and $P=P_{"sat"}$. The 'quality' x is the fraction of the mass that is a vapor. In every day life - this is the point when boiling a pot of pasta where the bubbles start to form. Steam and water coexist at this T, P. 

/ wet steam: steam with quality < 1
/ quality x: literally the fraction of mass that is vapor. When boiling a pot of pasta water, the quality starts at 0 and increases as more liquid vaporizes.
